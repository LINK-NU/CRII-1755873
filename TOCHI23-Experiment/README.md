# Beyond Words: An Experimental Study of Signaling in Crowdfunding (TOCHI23-Experiment)

Crowdfunding is increasingly transforming financing for many people across the globe. We conduct two studies of ùëÅ = 500 and ùëÅ = 750 participants involved in crowdfunding to investigate the effect of characteristics of prior contributions (‚Äúcrowd signals‚Äù) on their funding decisions. First, we detect the presence of signaling and then demonstrate its importance in a naturalistic context. We find that contributions of varying amounts arriving at heterogeneous time intervals are 19.7% more likely to be selected than homogeneous contribution amounts and times. Although the impact of signaling is strongest among participants who are susceptible to social influence, the effect is remarkably general and typically unrecognized by participants who attribute their decisions to nonexistent differences in project descriptions. These findings hold across different project types, fundraising goals, interest levels in the projects, and participants‚Äô altruistic attitudes. Our results underscore the importance of social signaling in crowdfunding, providing novel insights on how, when, and why signaling between funders is impacting funding outcomes.
